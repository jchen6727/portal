# Section 1.0.0 Opening a Door

The first interaction with a human that I remember was when I was 4 or 5. I was the only child of a single mother just out of her Neurology residency, and the best she could afford was a small sinking house where the doors would jam into their canted frames frequently. I had gone to use the bathroom, and found I could not force the door back open. I was trapped.

When I finally yelled to get my mother's attention, she found that she also could not open the door. That was when she began blaming me. The door was locked (it wasn't). I was holding the doorknob in place (I wasn't). I was pulling the door shut to mess with her (sure, why not). The combination of her angry accusations and my desperation to get out turned what should have been a straightforward solution (she turns the doorknob to disengage the latch and pulls, I throw my weight against the door and push) into a combination of experimental, never-work attempts. She asserts the door is locked -> I set the lock to the alternate position -> now the knob won't turn, why did I lock the door? . I must be pulling the door shut -> I step away from the door -> she still can't open the door -> I must be pulling the door shut. During the yelling she produced to force the door back open, my mother was inspired to think of a quite brilliant solution. The moment the door opened she wrenched me out and, between yelling at me and also yelling at me, she offered this brilliant solution -- via more yelling -- to the door problem: "I'M GOING TO CHAIN YOU TO A POLE!"

My first lesson in life was that closing the bathroom door might result in getting myself chained to a pole and that everything was my fault.

# Section 1.1.0 Piano Arms Race

Asian moms love dinner table comparisons and bragging about their children. It's a fucking competition between asian moms. I can't provide any data about asian dads because my asian dad drove his car straight-head-on-into a truck before I got a chance to remember his face. Maybe he committed suicide because he let my grandmother down.

I played an hour of piano each day from around the time I was threatened with being chained to a pole until college. Looking back, I was good, not great, and I hated every moment of it. My mother kept on comparing me to Penny (P.Y), who was my senior, and placed in all the regional competitions per My Asian Mom, and also, by the way, played the piano for 1 hour each day *happily* and never groaned about it. 

I bet My Asian Mom (M.A.M) and Penny's Asian Mom (P.A.M) had the perfect dynamic. P.A.M would tell Penny about how dissappointed she was because this other little kid was playing 1 hour of piano each day and already playing in competitions and then make Penny play piano for 1 hour a day. Then P.A.M would brag about how she could get Penny to play piano an hour a day *easy* because she finally got P.Y around to loving-playing-the- piano and that's-why-P.Y-got-into-nationals to M.A.M, so M.A.M could be dissapointed unless I continued playing for an hour a day too. Then, M.A.M could go back to P.A.M and talk about how she could get me to play an hour each day even-though-I-was-a-little-kid and how my-teacher-picked-a-Tchaikovsky-piece-for-me for the next state level even though I-was-so-young. 

It wasn't about personal growth or learning something new or--most importantly--how wonderful music is. It was about how much better P.Y was at piano than I was.

If I wasn't buddies with someone in college who just loved to play the piano *just because* I would have quit all music entirely. 1 hour / day * 364 day / year * 12 years in this instrument I would have happily dumped if I didn't encounter this random stranger. 

# Section 1.1.1 (Not) Two Standard Deviations Above Average

It wasn't worth doing something unless I was 2 standard deviations above average. Because exemplar asian kid (E.A.K) was 2 standard deviations above average easy, so why shouldn't M.A.M be disappointed that I wasn't working hard enough to be 2 standard deviations above average and make that the only point of discussion at all dinners in perpetuity?

# Section 1.2.0 No Asian Judges, but All Asians Judge

I was a judgmental little shit. I still am. When I listened to a girl my age playing the piano in highschool, all I could think about was how I already played the piece when I was a kid and how out of tempo she was, instead of the fact she was fucking good at piano and confident performing in front of a whole class of her peers and enjoyed it instead of being a miserable shit like I was. In medical school, I was roommates with another asian medical student. Most striking conversation I remember with them was when they dragged on an asian pharmacist (A.P), because obviously A.P had to pick a "back up" profession because he couldn't get into medical school like a proper asian.

# Section 1.2.1 Two Standard Deviations Again

I didn't do anything in public because everyone would compare me to E.A.K. I didn't talk because I might get chained to a pole because of it. As an average(?) looking Asian kid I got to modify my perceived social value with the fact that I was physically unattractive to a statistical majority of my peers as that extra -1 to stat. So there's this quiet, shy, ugly kid with low self esteem going to a school where everyone was beautiful and confident. In this situation I was *NOT* 2 standard deviations above average, so the logical thing to do was to avoid interacting with everyone and leave that talking point out of the discussion with M.A.M .

# Section 1.3.0 Doctor, Lawyer, or Engineer

My mom was a Doctor, my dad was going to *teach* Doctors (and that's probably what he told his M.A.M) until he drove himself into a truck. I was going to be an Engineer until I saw I was clearly not 2 Standard Deviations, and then decided to be a Doctor (following the Doctor, Lawyer, or Engineer paradigm). Then I realized I was never going to be 2 Standard Deviations as a Doctor but was finally ok with life at the end. Because. Finally. After chasing 2 professions I wasn't good at, and going halfway through a miserable residency and an ICU stay plus an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization -I-Finally-Learned- 2 Standard Deviations and chasing E.A.K is a STUPID FUCKING MISERABLE thing to base a life around. 

I'm gleefully average in my profession of NOT being a Doctor, Lawyer or Engineer. Maybe my job will end with a bunch of unhappy people because I didn't really do anything 2 Standard Deviations but I will continue to do a mediocre job and be happy about it because the same stubborness I applied to all the bullshit from before still exists. The strange thing is, even as a clearly not 2 Standard Deviations person, the phone calls with M.A.M still end up with the *upsell* where I BS about how I'll also be some kind of 2 Standard Deviations person because "not many people can do my job" and "its in high demand" and "its the cutting edge future" which is all bullshit. I'm too fucking old to be lying about my work.

But the thing I'll never understand is why *lawyer* (see 1.2.0) is part of that list. I know of no asian lawyers, and I can't imagine how a population raised to avoid others--unless 2 standard deviations--, have no self esteem--because not E.A.K--, and no charisma would ever succeed at that profession. 

*Oh, wait, E.A.K was a Lawyer*.

# Section 1 Conclusion

At the end of the day, what my mother managed to pull off was pretty significant because she herself was E.A.K enough to turn a suicidal teenager-turned-adult into a non-suicidal semi-functioning person. Also, historically, my M.A.M had her own M.A.M had her own M.A.M all the way back to whenever the asian race collectively decided to they would turn raising children into a whole fucking THING where everyone had to be miserable. The fact she didn't also constantly think about how difficult it is to jump off a building because there's-no-roof-access and the windows-that-are-large-enough-for-a-person-to-leap-through-have-security-railings is kind of a notable achievement (also, the non-negligible chance that modern medical science will decide to keep my body in a perpetual state of alive-and-in-pain if I fail, what with having a shattered skull and being kept on ventilator looks like). And given that my biological father basically failed through everything (by being dead for all of it), she had to be EXTRA E.A.K this whole way through in order to try to make an E.A.K out of her child, and then even more EXTRA EXTRA E.A.K when that child turned into a failure adult who was hospitalized multiple times and she was listed as the emergency contact.

What am I going to do though? Not be a fucking E.A.K. I'm finally too old and not good enough to be E.A.K and the best thing I can do is something else. And while I'm finally happy in my life -- and before I decide its not worth even remembering all the stupid details -- I decided to write all down all the reasons the idea of E.A.K is stupid. I might justify it as some way of freeing other people from the kind of wierd torment and penchant for depression it brings to childhood, but the fact is that *I am still a judgmental prick* (c.f. 1.2.0) so I think I'm just doing this for shits and giggles.

# Section 2.0.0 The Part Where I Do Bullshit RCA Just Like How HR Do.

In light of a laughable picture my medical residency friend sent me of an HR powerpoint mentioning *RCA* and *lean methods* and *green-belt* -- and the implication that some hospital ancillary at his safety-net hospital actually went elbows-deep into proper management methods (prior email to me re: same hospital: "By my RCA, the reason for HR failure was because everyone else. Based on this RCA, I recommend everyone else be better. The end.") c.f. 1.2.0, I will do a hospital-like-RCA of why the whole door incident (see 1.0.0) happened. Because as a non-resident, I now have both the money and time to pursue things just for fun.
